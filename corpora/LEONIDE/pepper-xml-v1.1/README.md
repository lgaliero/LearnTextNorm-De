LEONIDE - Learner Corpus in Italiano, Deutsch & English [v1.1](CHANGELOG.md) - Pepper XML contains the transcribed corpus in the Pepper XML format, used for conversion to other file formats like ANNIS.



## Description

LEONIDE is a collection of longitudinal learner data produced in the three languages 
Italian, German and English (Longitudinal lEarner cOrpus iN Italiano, Deutsch, English). 
The data was collected in the project “One school, many languages”, conducted in eight
 schools in the officially multilingual Italian province of South Tyrol – Alto Adige, with
 the aim to document the development of plurilingual competences 
of lower secondary school pupils obtaining a global view of their individual 
linguistic repertoire.

LEONIDE itself contains around 2.500 texts from 163 pupils, who participated in the project.
While the overall size of the corpus amounts to around 240.000 tokens, the corpus represents 
written productions from different years of the pupils lower secondary school career as well as
texts from different genres (opinion texts and picture story retelling) and languages (German, 
Italian and English). Subdivided by language, the corpus contains 850 Italian, 849 German and
 844 English texts.

All texts contain manually performed transcription annotations and linguistic error annotations.
Transcription annotations reflect surface features of the text, such as the
graphical arrangement and self-corrections.  Error annotations relate to the
orthographic level only. 

Person-related metadata provides information about:
- writer's L1(s)
- writer's gender
- writer's age
- writer's language assessment scores for each of the three languages
- writer's school id (for class effects)


In addition, the corpus is automatically annotated, including tokenisation,
sentence splitting, POS-tagging and lemmatization.
