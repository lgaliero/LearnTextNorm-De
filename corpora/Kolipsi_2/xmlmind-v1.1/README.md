## Description

The Kolipsi-2 Corpus is a written learner corpus of German and Italian
L2 speakers originating from South Tyrol (Italy). It has been developed
as a by-product of the KOLIPSI II project, a replication study of the
KOLIPSI project on “South-Tyrolean pupils and the second language: a
linguistic and socio-psychological investigation” that was conducted 7
years after the original study.

The data collection for this second edition took place in spring 2014
and is based on two standardized tests for written productions, that
were aligned with the original tasks for the KOLIPSI study. However,
while the first task remained the same for both editions, the second
task was slightly adapted. The two tasks consisted of (1) writing an
e-mail to a friend retelling a given event at the supermarket based on a
picture story (narrative text genre) and (2) writing an e-mail about
negative aspects of social-media chats prompted by a letter to the
editor in a youth magazine (argumentative text genre). For both tasks a
time limit of 25 minutes was fixed and no additional reference material
was allowed.

CEFR levels have been assigned to all L2 learner texts, providing a
holistic score as well as evaluations of coherence, sociolinguistic
appropriateness, lexical accuracy, lexical diversity, grammar and
orthography.

Person-related metadata provides information about:

- the writer’s language background, including L1(s), the L1(s) of mother
  and father, and a self-declared language group affiliation as well as
  the pre-dominant language spoken in the area the writer is residing in
- the writer’s results from an additional language test in the L2
  (dialang test)
- the writer’s competence in the local German dialect (for students with
  L1 Italian only)
- the writer’s age, gender and socio-economic status
- whether the writer lives in an urban or rural environment
- the language, location and type of school the writer attended
- an anonymous identifier for the writer’s school class to account for
  class effects

All texts have been transcribed manually adding transcription
annotations that reflect surface features of the text, such as the
graphical arrangement, and include error annotation on the orthographic
level.

In addition to that, all texts were automatically annotated, adding
tokenisation, sentence splitting, POS-tagging and lemmatization using an
orthographically corrected target version of the corpus.
