## Description

The Kolipsi-1 corpus is a written learner corpus of German and Italian
L2 speakers originating from South Tyrol (Italy). It has been developed
as a by-product of the KOLIPSI project “South-Tyrolean pupils and the
second language: a linguistic and socio-psychological investigation”. In
addition, data from L1 pupils were collected exclusively for the
creation of a native speaker reference corpus.

The data collection took place in autumn 2007 and is based on two
standardized tests for written productions. The two tasks consisted of
(1) writing an e-mail to a friend retelling a given event at the
supermarket based on a picture story (narrative text genre) and (2) in
writing a letter to a friend discussing holiday plans (argumentative
text genre). For both tasks a time limit of 30 minutes was fixed and no
additional reference material was allowed.

The Kolipsi-1 corpus contains 2063 Italian and 700 German texts from
1037 and 358 L2 writers respectively. The corpus has an overall size of
about 0.5 million tokens. CEFR levels have been assigned to all texts,
providing a holistic score as well as evaluations of coherence, lexis,
grammar and sociolinguistic appropriateness.

Person-related metadata provides information about:

- the writer’s language background, including L1(s), the L1(s) of mother
  and father, and a self-declared language group affiliation
- the writer’s age, gender and socio-economic status
- the writer’s district of residence and whether he lives in an urban or
  rural environment
- the language, location and type of school the writer attended
- whether the writer passed the local bilinguality exam or not
- an anonymous identifier for the writer’s school class and L2 teacher
  to account for class effects

Additionally, the download package contains a reference corpus of L1
texts for comparison. The L1 text corpus contains 82 Italian texts and
365 German texts from 44 and 184 writers respectively (in total about 90
000 tokens) and provides only a restricted set of metadata (unique
identifier for the writer, school and language background).

As all sub-corpora of the Kolipsi Corpus Family, Kolipsi-1 (L1 and L2)
contains manually performed transcription annotations. Transcription
annotations reflect surface features of the text, such as the graphical
arrangement, and include error annotation on the orthographic level. In
addition to that, all texts were automatically annotated, adding
tokenisation, sentence splitting, POS-tagging and lemmatization using an
orthographically corrected target version of the corpus.
